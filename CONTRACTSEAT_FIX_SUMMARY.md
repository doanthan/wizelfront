# ContractSeat Permission Fix for AI Chat

## Problem

When asking the chat questions like "how are my last 3 months worth of flows looking?", you got:

```
"I don't have access to any store data for your account. Please contact support if this seems incorrect."
```

## Root Cause

The Tier 2 handler was checking for `user.store_ids` (old field), but your system now uses **ContractSeat** for permissions.

```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD CODE (didn't work)
if (!user || !user.store_ids || user.store_ids.length === 0) {
  return error("No store access");
}
```

## Fix Applied

Updated Tier 2 handler to use ContractSeat permissions system:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ NEW CODE (works with ContractSeat)
// Get user's accessible stores via ContractSeat
const userSeats = await ContractSeat.find({
  user_id: user._id,
  status: 'active'
}).lean();

// Build accessible stores list based on seats
for (const seat of userSeats) {
  if (!seat.store_access || seat.store_access.length === 0) {
    // Empty store_access = access to ALL stores in contract
    // Get all contract stores
  } else {
    // Specific store access only
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

**File**: `/app/api/chat/ai/route.js`

**Section**: `handleTier2Analysis()` function (lines 354-467)

**What changed**:
1. ‚úÖ Removed check for `user.store_ids`
2. ‚úÖ Added ContractSeat query to get user's seats
3. ‚úÖ Added logic to build accessible stores list
4. ‚úÖ Added super admin check (can access all stores)
5. ‚úÖ Simplified store resolution to use accessible stores

## How It Works Now

### Permission Flow

```
User asks question
    ‚Üì
Get User from session
    ‚Üì
Is Super Admin?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Get all stores
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Get ContractSeats for user
             ‚Üì
         For each active seat:
           ‚îú‚îÄ Empty store_access? ‚Üí All stores in that contract
           ‚îî‚îÄ Has store_access?   ‚Üí Only those specific stores
             ‚Üì
         Merge all accessible stores (remove duplicates)
```

### Store Selection Priority

1. **UI-selected stores** (if user selected specific stores in dashboard)
2. **Context stores** (if passed from aiState)
3. **All accessible stores** (fallback - all stores user has permission to)

## Testing

Try your question again:

```
"how are my last 3 months worth of flows looking?"
```

**Expected behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Should now query all your accessible stores
- ‚úÖ Should route to ClickHouse for 3-month analysis
- ‚úÖ Should return flow performance data

**Logs to check**:
```bash
üìä Accessible stores found: 7
üîç Tier 2 SQL Analysis: {
  storeCount: 7,
  resolution: 'all_accessible',
  storeNames: ['Balmain', 'Balmain2', ...]
}
```

## Other Questions That Should Now Work

All these should now work properly:

```
"What are my top campaigns last month?"
"Show me flows with highest revenue"
"Compare my email vs SMS performance"
"Which products sold best last quarter?"
"How's my revenue trending?"
```

## Superuser vs Regular User

### Superuser
- `is_super_user: true`
- Can access **ALL stores** in the system
- No ContractSeat checks needed

### Regular User
- Checked via ContractSeat permissions
- Can access only stores they have seats for
- Empty `store_access` = all stores in that contract
- Specific `store_access` = only those stores

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/app/api/chat/ai/route.js` - Tier 2 handler permission logic

## Related Systems

This fix aligns with how permissions work elsewhere:

- `/app/api/dashboard/account-stats/route.js` - Uses same ContractSeat logic
- `/app/api/campaigns/recent/route.js` - Uses same ContractSeat logic
- All other API endpoints using ContractSeat permissions

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test with real queries
2. ‚è≥ Monitor logs for permission issues
3. ‚è≥ Verify all accessible stores are being included

## Rollback

If issues occur, the old `user.store_ids` check can be restored, but you'll need to populate `store_ids` on User documents for this to work.

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

The chat should now properly access your stores via ContractSeat permissions!
