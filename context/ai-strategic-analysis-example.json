  "exampleQuestions": {
    "strategic": [
      {
        "question": "Why is 'Black Friday' performing better than 'Cyber Monday'?",
        "answer": "Black Friday earned 44% more revenue primarily due to:\n1. 70% discount vs 50% discount (higher value proposition)\n2. Emoji in subject line (ðŸ”¥) increased open rate by 16%\n3. Better send time (Friday 10am vs Monday 8am)\n4. Stronger urgency language ('Today Only' vs 'Ends Tonight')\n\nThe data shows discount amount and timing were the key differentiators."
      },
      {
        "question": "What campaigns should I do next?",
        "answer": "Based on your top performers, here are 5 recommended campaigns:\n\n1. **Create discount-driven campaign** (High Priority)\n   - 2 of your top 3 campaigns included discounts\n   - Launch a limited-time 40-60% off sale\n   - Expected: High revenue based on historical performance\n\n2. **Target VIP Customers** (High Priority)\n   - Your VIP segment has 4.56% conversion rate vs 2.16% average\n   - Create exclusive early access or VIP-only products\n   - Expected: 2-3x higher conversion rates\n\n3. **Schedule for Friday 10am** (Medium Priority)\n   - Your highest revenue campaign was sent Friday 10am\n   - Replicate this proven timing\n\n4. **Create another promotional campaign** (Medium Priority)\n   - Promotional campaigns generated $213K (68% of top revenue)\n   - Focus on time-limited offers with clear discounts\n\n5. **A/B test Black Friday variations** (Medium Priority)\n   - Test different discount amounts (60% vs 70%)\n   - Test emoji variations (ðŸ”¥ vs âš¡ vs none)\n   - Test subject line urgency levels"
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use emojis in subject lines?",
        "answer": "Yes, but strategically. Your data shows:\n- Emojis increase open rates by 16%\n- 'Black Friday ðŸ”¥' had 34.6% open rate\n- 'Cyber Monday' (no emoji) had 29.9% open rate\n\nRecommendation: Use emojis for promotional/urgent campaigns, but test different emojis to see what resonates with your audience. ðŸ”¥ and âš¡ tend to work well for sales."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which audience segment should I focus on?",
        "answer": "Focus on expanding your VIP Customers segment:\n\n**VIP Customers** (your best segment):\n- 45.7% open rate (vs 32.2% average)\n- 9.87% click rate (vs 5.32% average)\n- 4.56% conversion rate (vs 2.16% average)\n- $4,208 revenue per campaign on average\n\nActionable steps:\n1. Create a VIP tier program to grow this segment\n2. Send VIP-exclusive campaigns 2-3x per month\n3. Offer early access, exclusive products, or higher discounts\n4. Move top customers from 'All Subscribers' to VIP based on purchase history"
      },
      {
        "question": "What discount percentage works best?",
        "answer": "Your data shows 70% discount outperformed 50%:\n\n- **70% off**: $125K revenue, 34.6% open rate\n- **50% off**: $87K revenue, 29.9% open rate\n\nHowever, consider:\n1. Higher discounts may reduce margins\n2. VIP campaign with NO discount generated $98K with 45.7% open rate\n3. Value proposition matters more than discount size for VIP segment\n\nRecommendation:\n- **Mass market**: 50-70% discounts during peak seasons\n- **VIP segment**: Exclusivity > discounts (early access, limited editions)\n- **Test**: 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% to find sweet spot for your margins"
      }
    ],

    "tactical": [
      {
        "question": "What's the best day to send campaigns?",
        "answer": "Friday generated the highest revenue ($125K), but Tuesday had the best engagement:\n\n- **Friday 10am**: $125K revenue (promotional campaign)\n- **Tuesday 2pm**: $98K revenue (VIP campaign, 45.7% open rate)\n- **Monday 8am**: $87K revenue (lower engagement)\n\nRecommendation: Tuesday-Friday are your best days. Avoid Monday mornings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What subject line patterns work best?",
        "answer": "Your top performers show these patterns:\n\n1. **Emoji + Urgency + Discount**\n   - 'ðŸ”¥ Black Friday - 70% Off Everything (Today Only!)'\n   - 34.6% open rate, $125K revenue\n\n2. **Exclusivity + Value**\n   - 'Exclusive Preview: New Winter Collection'\n   - 45.7% open rate (VIP segment)\n\n3. **Urgency + Deadline**\n   - 'Final Hours: Cyber Monday Sale Ends Tonight'\n   - 29.9% open rate\n\nKey elements: Clear value prop, urgency/scarcity, specific discount amount"
