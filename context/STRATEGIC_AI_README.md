### Question: "Should I use emojis in subject lines?"

**AI Response:**
> Yes! Your data shows emojis increase open rates by **16%**:
>
> - **With emoji**: "🔥 Black Friday - 70% Off" → 34.6% open rate
> - **Without emoji**: "Cyber Monday Sale Ends Tonight" → 29.9% open rate
>
> **Best practices from your data**:
> - Use emojis for promotional/urgent campaigns (sales, limited offers)
> - 🔥 (fire) performed best for your Black Friday campaign
> - Test ⚡ (lightning), 🎁 (gift), or ⏰ (clock) for time-sensitive offers
> - Skip emojis for professional/VIP communications (your VIP campaign without emoji had 45.7% open rate)
>
> **Recommendation**: Use emojis strategically - they work for mass promotions but may not be needed for high-value segments.

### Question: "Which audience segment should I focus on?"

**AI Response:**
> **Focus on VIP Customers** - they're your most valuable segment:
>
> **VIP Customers Performance:**

> - **Revenue per Campaign**: $98K average
>
> **Action Plan:**

>    - Purchase frequency (3+ purchases)
>    - Lifetime value (>$500)
>    - Engagement score (consistently opens/clicks)
>
> 2. **Increase targeting**: Send 2-3 VIP-exclusive campaigns per month
>
> 3. **VIP-only benefits**:
>    - Early access to new collections
>    - Exclusive products not available to general list
>    - Higher discount tiers (VIPs get 30% when everyone gets 20%)
>
> 4. **Test**: VIP campaigns work better with exclusivity than discounts
>    - "Exclusive Preview" outperformed promotional campaigns for this segment
>    - Focus on scarcity and special access over price cuts
>
> **Expected Impact**: Growing VIP segment by 50% could add $50K+ monthly revenue.
