## 🏗️ Table Engine Strategy

### Quick RMT Query Patterns
```sql
-- Simple SELECT
SELECT * FROM table_name FINAL WHERE ...;

-- Aggregations
SELECT sum(column) FROM table_name FINAL GROUP BY ...;

-- JOINs (FINAL on both)
FROM table1 FINAL t1 JOIN table2 FINAL t2 ON ...;

-- INSERT with version
INSERT INTO table (..., version_col) VALUES (..., now());

-- CTEs with FINAL
WITH cte AS (SELECT * FROM table FINAL WHERE ...)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

### Engine Types & Usage Patterns

| Category | Tables | Version Column | Query Method |
|----------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Marketing Stats** (4) | campaign, flow, form, segment | `updated_at` | `FINAL` |
| **Order Data** (3) | orders, line_items, refunds | `inserted_at` | `FINAL` |
| **Aggregations** (3) | account_metrics, campaign_daily, customer_profiles | Various | `FINAL` |
| **Product Analytics** (2) | products_master, product_relationships | Various | `FINAL` |
| **Total: 12 RMT Tables** | All tables | Per table | Always `FINAL` |

### 🎯 New Simplified Architecture Benefits

With the addition of `campaign_daily_aggregates`:
1. **10x Faster Queries**: Pre-aggregated data eliminates complex nested queries
2. **No ERROR 184**: Avoids illegal nested aggregation errors
3. **Simpler Code**: Direct JOINs instead of CTEs with argMax
4. **More Metrics**: Channel breakdowns, best performers, tag analysis
5. **Cost Savings**: Less ClickHouse compute per dashboard load

### ⏺ Critical: Universal ReplacingMergeTree Query Patterns

The following tables use **ReplacingMergeTree** and receive new rows every 15 minutes:
- `campaign_statistics` (version: `updated_at`)
- `flow_statistics` (version: `updated_at`)
- `form_statistics` (version: `updated_at`)
- `segment_statistics` (version: `updated_at`) ✅ Migrated 2025-09-18

#### ✅ Correct Query Patterns:

**For Campaign Statistics (using FINAL for deduplication):**
```sql
-- CORRECT: Get latest values per campaign using FINAL
SELECT
    date,
    campaign_id,
    campaign_name,
    recipients,
    delivered,
    opens,
    clicks,
    conversion_value as revenue
FROM campaign_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String};

-- For daily aggregation (simplified with FINAL):
SELECT
    date,
    count(distinct campaign_id) as total_campaigns,
    sum(recipients) as total_recipients,
    sum(conversion_value) as total_revenue
FROM campaign_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String}
GROUP BY date;
```

**For Flow Statistics (using FINAL for deduplication):**
```sql
-- CORRECT: Get latest values per flow message using FINAL
SELECT
    date,
    flow_id,
    flow_name,
    flow_message_id,
    flow_message_name,
    recipients,
    delivered,
    opens_unique as opens,
    clicks_unique as clicks,
    conversion_value as revenue
FROM flow_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String};

-- For daily flow aggregation (simplified with FINAL):
SELECT
    date,
    flow_id,
    flow_name,
    count(distinct flow_message_id) as active_messages,
    sum(recipients) as total_recipients,
    sum(conversion_value) as total_revenue
FROM flow_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String}
GROUP BY date, flow_id, flow_name;
```

**For Form Statistics (using FINAL for deduplication):**
```sql
-- CORRECT: Get latest values per form using FINAL
SELECT
    date,
    form_id,
    form_name,
    submits,
    submits_unique as unique_submits,
    conversion_value as revenue
FROM form_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String};
```

**For Segment Statistics (using FINAL for deduplication):**
```sql
-- CORRECT: Get latest values per segment using FINAL
SELECT
    date,
    segment_id,
    segment_name,
    members_count as member_count,
    conversion_value as revenue
FROM segment_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String};
```

#### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid:
```sql
-- WRONG: Without FINAL, may get duplicate records
SELECT recipients FROM campaign_statistics;

-- CORRECT: Use FINAL to get deduplicated latest version
SELECT recipients FROM campaign_statistics FINAL;

-- For aggregations, always use FINAL:
SELECT sum(recipients) FROM campaign_statistics FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String}
GROUP BY date;

-- Or use pre-aggregated tables:
SELECT total_campaigns, email_recipients + sms_recipients as total_recipients
FROM campaign_daily_aggregates FINAL
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {klaviyo_public_id:String} AND date = today();
```

#### Impact on Aggregations:
When these tables feed into `campaign_daily_aggregates` and `account_metrics_daily`:
1. **First**: Query with `FINAL` to get deduplicated records
2. **Then**: Aggregate the deduplicated values
3. **Result**: Accurate metrics with ReplacingMergeTree's automatic deduplication

### Why This Architecture?

```sql
-- Marketing Stats: Multiple updates per day, automatic deduplication
SELECT
    flow_id,
    recipients as current_recipients,
    conversion_value as current_revenue
FROM flow_statistics FINAL  -- FINAL ensures latest version
WHERE date = today();

-- Account Metrics: One record per day, RMT handles deduplication
SELECT total_revenue, total_orders
FROM account_metrics_daily FINAL  -- FINAL gets deduplicated version
WHERE date = today();
```

## ⚡ Performance & Query Patterns

### 1. Engine-Specific Query Optimization

```sql
-- ✅ Marketing Stats (MergeTree): Use argMax for latest values
SELECT
    flow_id,
    argMax(recipients, updated_at) as current_recipients
FROM flow_statistics
WHERE date = today()
GROUP BY flow_id;

-- ✅ Account Metrics (RMT): Use FINAL for deduplication
SELECT total_revenue
FROM account_metrics_daily FINAL
WHERE date = today();

-- ✅ Analytics (RMT): Use FINAL for latest customer data
SELECT customer_email, total_revenue
FROM customer_profiles FINAL
WHERE rfm_segment = 'Champions';
```

### 2. Performance Rules

```sql
-- ✅ Always filter by klaviyo_public_id first (partition key)
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = 'XqkVGb' AND date >= today() - 7

-- ✅ Use specific date ranges
WHERE date >= today() - 30 AND date <= today()

-- ✅ Limit data for real-time widgets
WHERE date = today()  -- For today-only widgets

-- ❌ Avoid broad date ranges for real-time queries
WHERE date > '2020-01-01'  -- Too broad
```

### 3. Debugging Queries

```sql
-- Check Data Freshness
SELECT
    'flow_statistics' as table_name,
    max(updated_at) as last_updated,
    count(*) as todays_records
FROM flow_statistics
WHERE date = today()

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'campaign_statistics' as table_name,
    max(updated_at) as last_updated,
    count(*) as todays_records
FROM campaign_statistics
WHERE date = today();

-- Verify Deduplication is Working
SELECT
    flow_id,
    date,
    count(*) as versions,
    min(updated_at) as first_update,
    max(updated_at) as last_update
FROM flow_statistics
WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {storeId:String}
  AND date = today()
GROUP BY flow_id, date
HAVING versions > 1
ORDER BY versions DESC;
```

### 4. Caching Strategy
```javascript
// lib/cache.js
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache';

// Real-time data: Short cache (5 minutes)
export const getCachedRealTimeMetrics = unstable_cache(
  async (storeId) => {
    return fetchTodaysMetrics(storeId);
  },
  ['realtime-metrics'],
  {
    revalidate: 300, // 5 minutes
    tags: ['metrics', 'realtime']
  }
);

// Historical data: Longer cache (1 hour)
export const getCachedHistoricalMetrics = unstable_cache(
  async (storeId, days) => {
    return fetchHistoricalMetrics(storeId, days);
  },
  ['historical-metrics'],
  {
    revalidate: 3600, // 1 hour
    tags: ['metrics', 'historical']
  }
);
```

## 🔐 Security & RMT Best Practices

### 1. Parameterized Queries with FINAL
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Parameterized + FINAL
const result = await client.query({
  query: 'SELECT * FROM orders FINAL WHERE klaviyo_public_id = {storeId:String}',
  query_params: { storeId: userInput }
});

// ❌ WRONG - Missing FINAL and concatenation
const result = await client.query({
  query: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE klaviyo_public_id = '${userInput}'`
});
```

### 2. INSERT Best Practices
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Include version column
const result = await client.insert({
  table: 'customer_profiles',
  values: [{
    email: 'user@example.com',
    total_orders: 5,
    last_updated: new Date()  // Version column
  }]
});

// ❌ WRONG - Missing version column
const result = await client.insert({
  table: 'customer_profiles',
  values: [{
    email: 'user@example.com',
    total_orders: 5
    // Missing last_updated
  }]
});
```

### 2. Access Control
```javascript
// middleware.js
export async function middleware(request) {
  const session = await getSession(request);
  const storeId = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('storeId');

  if (!session.stores.includes(storeId)) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 });
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **No data showing**: Check `klaviyo_public_id` filter and sync status
2. **Slow queries**: Use aggregated tables, add time filters, check engine types
3. **Incorrect metrics**: Ensure ALL queries use `FINAL` modifier (all tables are RMT)
4. **Missing real-time data**: Check if 15-minute sync is running
5. **Duplicate data showing**: Add `FINAL` modifier to your queries

### Engine-Specific Debugging
```sql
-- Check table engines
SELECT
    table,
    engine,
    engine_full
FROM system.tables
WHERE database = currentDatabase()
  AND table IN ('flow_statistics', 'campaign_statistics', 'account_metrics_daily');

-- Check for duplicate versions (RMT deduplication)
SELECT
    'Without FINAL' as query_type,
    count(*) as row_count
FROM campaign_statistics
WHERE date = today()
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'With FINAL' as query_type,
    count(*) as row_count
FROM campaign_statistics FINAL
WHERE date = today();
```

**Implementation Status**: ALL 12 tables are now **ReplacingMergeTree** with automatic deduplication.

## 🔴 CRITICAL REMINDERS:

**ALWAYS use `FINAL` modifier on EVERY query** - No exceptions!

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - May return duplicates
SELECT * FROM any_table WHERE ...;

-- ✅ CORRECT - Returns deduplicated data
SELECT * FROM any_table FINAL WHERE ...;
```

**Remember**:
- ALL tables: **ReplacingMergeTree** → ALWAYS use `FINAL`
- INSERT operations: ALWAYS include version column
- JOINs: Use `FINAL` on BOTH tables
- Subqueries/CTEs: Use `FINAL` inside them too
- Performance: Filter by partition keys when possible

**Quick Reference**:
```sql
-- SELECT template
SELECT ... FROM table FINAL WHERE ...;

-- JOIN template
FROM table1 FINAL t1 JOIN table2 FINAL t2 ON ...;

-- INSERT template
INSERT INTO table (..., version_column) VALUES (..., now());

-- Aggregation template
SELECT ... FROM table FINAL GROUP BY ...;
```
