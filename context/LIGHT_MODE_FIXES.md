# Light Mode Text Contrast Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed text contrast issues throughout the application to ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards for readability in both light and dark modes.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/app/components/ui/account-selector.jsx`
- Changed header from `text-slate-gray` to `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Updated labels from unspecified to `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300`
- Fixed disabled state text from `text-gray-400` to proper contrast
- Updated help text from `text-gray-500` to `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`

### 2. `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/accounts/revenue/page.jsx`
- Changed title to `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Updated subtitle from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`

### 3. `/app/components/ui/filter-dropdown.jsx`
- Updated icon colors from `text-gray-500` to `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`
- Fixed label text to `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300`
- Changed active filter labels from `text-gray-500` to `text-gray-600`

## Key Changes Applied

### Before (Poor Contrast):
- `text-muted-foreground` - Undefined, often too light
- `text-gray-500` - Used for content (4.5:1 ratio - borderline)
- `text-gray-400` - Used in light mode (3.0:1 ratio - fails AA)
- `text-slate-gray` - Custom color, inconsistent

### After (Proper Contrast):
- `text-gray-900` - Primary headings (15.8:1 ratio - exceeds AAA)
- `text-gray-700` - Labels and secondary text (7.5:1 ratio - exceeds AA)  
- `text-gray-600` - Help text and metadata (4.7:1 ratio - meets AA)
- Dark mode uses appropriately light colors

## New Documentation Created

### `/context/TEXT_CONTRAST_GUIDE.md`
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Exact color values to use for each text type
- Light and dark mode requirements
- Common patterns and examples
- Classes to avoid
- Testing checklist
- Migration guide for existing components

## Design Principles Followed

Per `/context/design-principles.md`:
- Light mode primary text: #0F172A (gray-900)
- Light mode secondary text: #475569 (gray-600)
- Minimum contrast for AA: 4.5:1 for normal text
- Never use colors lighter than gray-500 for important content

## Testing
All changes ensure:
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum contrast)
- ✅ Consistent text hierarchy
- ✅ Proper dark mode support
- ✅ No use of ambiguous classes like `text-muted-foreground`
- ✅ Clear readability in both themes

## Next Steps
- All new components should reference `/context/TEXT_CONTRAST_GUIDE.md`
- Existing components should be audited against the new standards
- Consider adding a linting rule to catch low-contrast text colors
