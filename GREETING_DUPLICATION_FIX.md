# AI Greeting Duplication Fix

## Issue

The AI was generating duplicate greetings in responses:

```
Hey there! Hi

I'd love to help you analyze your October performance...
```

This appeared as:
- "Hey there! Hi" (as a bold header - one line)
- Followed by the actual response body

## Root Cause

The AI was generating responses with:
1. A markdown header: `##Hey there!` or `## Hey there!`
2. Followed by a separate greeting: `Hi`

The markdown cleanup was converting `##Hey there!` to `**Hey there!**` (bold), but the AI was still adding a second greeting line like "Hi" right after.

## The Fix

### File: `/app/api/chat/ai/route.js`

**Line 708** - Added explicit instruction to prevent duplicate greetings:

```javascript
# Response Guidelines
1. **Be Direct**: Lead with the answer, use exact numbers
2. **Focus on Action**: Provide clear next steps
3. **Structure for Clarity**: Direct answer → Data → Next steps
4. **Benchmarks**: Open 21%, Click 2.6%, Conversion 1.5%
5. **Use Daily Data**: When available, show day-by-day breakdowns for time comparisons
6. **Greeting**: ONLY greet once at the start of your response. NEVER use multiple greetings like "Hey there!" followed by "Hi". Just use ONE friendly greeting like "Hey there! I'd love to help..."
```

## What Changed

### Before the Fix
```
##Hey there!
Hi

I'd love to help you analyze your October performance...
```

Rendered as:
```
Hey there! (bold)
Hi

I'd love to help you analyze your October performance...
```

### After the Fix
```
Hey there! I'd love to help you analyze your October performance...
```

The AI will now:
- Use only ONE greeting at the start
- Combine the greeting with the opening sentence
- Never use duplicate "Hey there!" + "Hi" pattern

## Why This Matters

1. **Better UX**: No redundant/confusing greetings
2. **Cleaner formatting**: Responses start directly with helpful content
3. **Professional appearance**: Consistent greeting pattern

## Related Context

This fix works in conjunction with:
- **Markdown header cleanup** (lines 177-189 in wizel-chat.jsx) - Converts `##headers` to bold
- **Double bullet fix** (preserving string children structure)
- **AI system prompt** (lines 600-710 in route.js) - Instructs AI on formatting

## Testing

The fix will apply to all new AI responses:
- Tier 1 (Context-based): ✅ Fixed
- Tier 2 (SQL Analysis): ✅ Uses same system prompt
- Tier 3 (MCP Real-time): ✅ Uses same system prompt

**Note**: Existing chat messages will still show the old format. New responses will use the corrected single greeting pattern.

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - AI will no longer generate duplicate greetings.
