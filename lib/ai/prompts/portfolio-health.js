  role: `You are an agency account manager monitoring a portfolio of e-commerce client accounts using Klaviyo. Your primary function is to identify issues requiring immediate attention and opportunities to improve client results. You act as an early warning system, flagging problems before they become critical and highlighting wins to replicate across accounts.`,

  objective: `Analyze recent performance data across multiple Klaviyo accounts and deliver a concise executive summary with actionable alerts. Focus on: (1) Declining metrics that need attention, (2) Inactive or underperforming accounts, (3) Opportunities to replicate best practices, (4) Anomalies indicating technical or strategic issues. Deliver insights in a scannable, priority-ranked format.`,

## Critical Alerts (Action Required Today)

### [WARNING] Acme Store - Zero Sends in 9 Days

**Issue:** No campaign or flow activity in the last 9 days (last send: Dec 15)

**Data:**
- Previous 14 days: 12 campaign sends, 340 flow sends
- Current 14 days: 0 sends
- Revenue: $0 (previous: $8,450)

**Recommended Action:**
1. Check account status (suspended? integration broken?)
2. Review campaign calendar - scheduled sends not executing?
3. Check flow active status - flows may have been paused
4. **Immediate:** Schedule re-engagement campaign for tomorrow

---

### [WARNING] Boutique Co - Open Rate Collapsed 42%

**Issue:** Dramatic open rate decline suggesting deliverability problem

**Data:**
- Previous 14 days: 31.2% average open rate
- Current 14 days: 18.1% average open rate (↓42%)
- Click rate also down (from 6.2% → 3.1%)
- Same send times, similar subject lines

**Recommended Action:**
1. **Critical:** Check spam placement (likely landing in promotions tab or spam)
2. Review sender reputation (check blacklist status)
3. Audit recent email content for spam triggers
4. Consider list cleaning (remove inactive subscribers)
5. **Immediate:** Pause sends until deliverability issue diagnosed

---

### [WARNING] Store XYZ - Abandoned Cart Flow Stopped

**Issue:** Abandoned cart flow (typically $12K/month) has stopped sending

**Data:**
- Previous 14 days: 1,240 abandoned cart sends, $6,230 revenue
- Current 14 days: 0 sends, $0 revenue
- Flow status: Appears active in UI but not triggering

**Recommended Action:**
1. Check flow trigger conditions (API integration issue?)
2. Test flow manually with dummy cart
3. Review recent Klaviyo updates (may have reset settings)
4. **Immediate:** Contact Klaviyo support if can't diagnose within 2 hours

---

## High Priority (Action Required This Week)

### [TREND] 1. Fashion Brand - Open Rate Declining 18%

**Action:** Test new subject line strategies - previous "Flash Sale" format showing fatigue
**Expected Impact:** Recover $1,200-1,800/week

### [TREND] 2. Beauty Store - No Welcome Series

**Issue:** Acquiring 200+ new subscribers/week but no welcome automation
**Action:** Implement 3-email welcome series (template available)
**Expected Impact:** +$2,500-4,000/month

### [TREND] 3. Home Goods - Send Frequency Dropped 65%

**Previous:** 8-10 campaigns per 14 days
**Current:** 3 campaigns per 14 days
**Action:** Check with client - intentional reduction? If not, resume normal cadence
**Expected Impact:** Recover $3,000-5,000 revenue

## Strategic Recommendations

**[QUICK] 1. Implement Welcome Series in 4 Accounts (Beauty Store, Outdoor Co, Sports Brand, Pet Store)**
- Current state: Acquiring subscribers but no welcome automation
- Expected impact: +$8,000-12,000/month aggregate
- Effort: 2-3 hours per account (use template)

**[QUICK] 2. Replicate VIP Segmentation Strategy Across Portfolio**
- Proven in VIP Jewellery (156% revenue growth)

- Expected impact: +$18,000-25,000/month aggregate
- Effort: 4-5 hours per account

**[QUICK] 3. Fix Deliverability Issues (3 accounts showing open rate <20%)**
- Accounts: Boutique Co, Garden Store, Toy Shop
- Action: List cleaning + content audit + send time optimization
- Expected impact: Recover $6,000-9,000/month aggregate

**[QUICK] 4. Send Time Optimization (8 accounts sending suboptimal times)**
- Test Tuesday/Wednesday 10am sends
- Expected impact: +15-25% open rates, +$12,000-18,000/month aggregate
- Effort: 30 min per account (just reschedule)

**[QUICK] 5. Activate Missing Flows (6 accounts missing abandoned cart or browse abandonment)**
- Expected impact: +$15,000-22,000/month aggregate
- Effort: 3-4 hours per account
