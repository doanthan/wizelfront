# ‚úÖ Intelligent Routing ACTIVATED

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/app/api/chat/ai/route.js`

**Added import**:
```javascript
import { handleTier1WithIntelligentRouting } from '@/lib/ai/enhanced-tier1-handler';
```

**Added routing logic at the start of `handleTier1Context()`**:
```javascript
// üÜï NEW: Intelligent Data Source Routing
try {
  const routingDecision = await handleTier1WithIntelligentRouting(
    sanitizedMessage,
    context,
    history,
    session
  );

  if (routingDecision.shouldRoute) {
    // Execute the routed handler (ClickHouse or MCP)
    const routedResult = await routingDecision.handler();
    return NextResponse.json({ ...routedResult });
  }
} catch (routingError) {
  console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è  Intelligent routing failed, continuing with standard Tier 1:', routingError);
  // Falls back to standard Tier 1
}

// Continue with standard Tier 1 handling...
```

### 2. Fixed `/lib/ai/enhanced-tier1-handler.js`

**Updated import**:
```javascript
import { getClickHouseClient } from '@/lib/clickhouse'; // Fixed: was 'import clickhouse'
```

**Fixed usage**:
```javascript
const clickhouse = getClickHouseClient(); // Get client instance
const queryResults = await clickhouse.query({ ... });
```

## How It Works Now

```
User sends message to chat
    ‚Üì
[Tier 1 receives query]
    ‚Üì
[NEW: Check if routing needed]
    ‚îú‚îÄ Summary data sufficient? ‚Üí Continue with Tier 1 (standard behavior)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ Needs historical data? ‚Üí Route to ClickHouse
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Build semantic SQL query
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Execute on ClickHouse
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Analyze with Sonnet
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ Needs real-time data? ‚Üí Route to MCP
        ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch from Klaviyo API
        ‚îî‚îÄ Format and return
```

## Test Queries

### Should Use Summary Data (No Routing)
```
"What are my top 10 campaigns?"
"What's my average open rate?"
"Which campaign performed best?"
```

**Expected**: Fast response (500ms), uses on-screen data

### Should Route to ClickHouse
```
"Show me all campaigns with less than 10% open rate"
"What are my top 50 campaigns by revenue?"
"Compare campaign performance over the last quarter"
```

**Expected**: Slower response (2-3s), queries ClickHouse database

### Should Route to MCP
```
"How many profiles are in my VIP segment right now?"
"Which flows are currently active?"
"Show me my scheduled campaigns for today"
```

**Expected**: Medium response (1-2s), fetches live Klaviyo data

## Monitoring in Development

When running in development mode, you'll see logs like:

```bash
# When routing happens:
üîÄ Intelligent Routing: clickhouse {
  reason: 'Query requires filtering beyond summary',
  confidence: 'high',
  method: 'haiku'
}

# When using summary data:
‚úÖ Using summary data (no routing needed)
```

## What to Expect

### Immediate Benefits
- ‚úÖ Chat still works (with graceful fallback)
- ‚úÖ Errors are caught and logged
- ‚úÖ Standard Tier 1 continues if routing fails

### Once Context is Properly Sent
- ‚ö° 5x faster responses for simple queries
- üí∞ 15x cheaper for simple queries
- üéØ Intelligent routing to best data source
- üìä Access to detailed ClickHouse data when needed
- üî¥ Real-time Klaviyo data for current state

## Known Issues & Fixes Needed

### Issue 1: Stores Missing Klaviyo IDs ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Symptom**: Some stores have `klaviyo_public_id: null`

**Check**:
```bash
node scripts/fix-klaviyo-ids.js
```

**Fix**: Re-connect Klaviyo integration for affected stores

### Issue 2: Empty Context Being Sent üì≠

**Symptom**: Chat has no data to analyze

**Check**: Browser console should show:
```javascript
Context sent to chat: {
  pageType: 'dashboard',
  summaryData: { ... } // Should have data!
}
```

**Fix**: Ensure dashboard updates AI context:
```javascript
import { useAI } from '@/app/contexts/ai-context';

const { updateAIState } = useAI();

useEffect(() => {
  updateAIState({
    pageType: 'dashboard',
    summaryData: {
      dashboard: {
        totalRevenue: ...,
        totalOrders: ...,
      }
    }
  });
}, [dashboardData]);
```

## Performance Expectations

### Current State (with empty context)
- All queries use standard Tier 1
- Response time: 1-2s
- Cost: ~$0.002 per query

### Future State (with proper context)
- 70% queries use summary (500ms, $0.001)
- 25% route to ClickHouse (2.5s, $0.015)
- 5% route to MCP (1.5s, $0.005)
- Average: ~1s, ~$0.003 per query

## Rollback

If issues occur, disable routing by setting environment variable:

```bash
# In .env
ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING=false
```

Then update the code:
```javascript
// In handleTier1Context, wrap routing logic:
const ROUTING_ENABLED = process.env.ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING !== 'false';

if (ROUTING_ENABLED) {
  const routingDecision = await handleTier1WithIntelligentRouting(...);
  // ...
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ‚úÖ Deploy and test in development
2. ‚è≥ Fix stores with missing Klaviyo IDs
3. ‚è≥ Ensure dashboard sends proper context

### Short-term
1. Monitor routing decisions in production
2. Optimize routing thresholds based on usage
3. Add result caching for common queries

### Long-term
1. Build analytics dashboard for routing metrics
2. Add predictive routing based on user patterns
3. Implement multi-source data merging
