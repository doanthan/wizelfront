# ✅ Implementation Complete: AI Store Context & Two-Tier System

## What Was Built

### 1. **Store & Brand Models Updated** ✅

#### Store Model (`/models/Store.js`)
Added `store_description` field for AI context:
```javascript
store_description: {
  summary: "Premium supplement brand targeting health-conscious millennials",
  primary_industry: "Health & Wellness - Supplements",
  region: "Australia",
  store_nickname: "The Supplement Powerhouse",
  brand_positioning_tags: ["premium quality", "third-party tested"],
  primary_demographic: {
    age_range: "25-40 year old millennials",
    gender_focus: "Primarily women",
    income_level: "Affluent consumers"
  },
  marketing_strengths: ["Strong email flows", "High engagement"],
  ai_estimated_customer_ltv: {
    average_value: 400,
    currency: "USD",
    average_purchases: 2.8
  },
  business_stage: "Well-established brand with mature marketing",
  unique_characteristics: ["Third-party testing", "Sustainability focus"]
}
```

#### Brand Model (`/models/Brand.js`)
- ✅ Updated `css` field to new Claude-generated design system
- ✅ Added `store_description` field (same as Store model)
- ✅ Updated helper methods (`getCssVariables`, `getEmailStyles`, etc.)

### 2. **Tiered Context System** ✅

#### `/lib/ai-store-context.js`
Smart context builder that automatically adapts:

| Stores | Mode | Context Level | Tokens |
|--------|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | single | Full detail | ~1,000 |
| 2-5 | small_group | Full for all | ~3,000 |
| 6-20 | medium/filtered | Smart filtering | ~4,000 |
| 20+ | large_filtered/summary | Minimal + focused | ~2,000-5,500 |

**Features:**
- Automatic mode selection
- Smart filtering (top/bottom performers)
- Store mention detection
- Query-based filtering

### 3. **Haiku Store Identifier** ✅

#### `/lib/ai-store-identifier.js`
Uses Claude Haiku ($0.0001/request) to identify stores from natural language:

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Identifies stores by name ("Premium Supplements")
- ✅ Identifies by nickname ("the supplement powerhouse")
- ✅ Identifies by ID ("XqkVGb")
- ✅ Filters by region ("Australian brands")
- ✅ Filters by performance ("bottom 3", "top 5")
- ✅ Filters by metrics ("low repeat rate", "high AOV")

**Filter Types Supported:**
- `specific` - Named stores
- `top` - Top N performers
- `bottom` - Bottom N performers
- `low_repeat` - Low retention stores
- `high_aov` - Premium/luxury stores
- `all` - All stores (asks for clarification if >20)

### 4. **Two-Tier API Endpoint** ✅

#### `/app/api/ai/chat-tiered/route.js`
Complete chatbot endpoint with two-tier architecture:

**Flow:**
```
User Query → Haiku (identify) → Context Builder (tier) → Sonnet (analyze)
```

**Example:**
```javascript
POST /api/ai/chat-tiered
{
  "message": "How are my Australian supplement brands doing?",
  "storeIds": [...30 store IDs]
}

// Haiku identifies: 2 stores (Australia + Supplements)
// Context: Full for 2 stores (~1,600 tokens)
// Sonnet: Analyzes with rich context
// Total cost: $0.005 vs $0.072 traditional
```

## 📊 Performance & Cost

### Traditional Approach
```
30 stores → Send all to Sonnet
Tokens: ~24,000 (30 × 800)
Cost: $0.072 per query
```

### Two-Tier Approach
```
30 stores → Haiku identifies 2-3 → Sonnet analyzes
Tokens: ~2,800 (400 Haiku + 2,400 Sonnet)
Cost: $0.008 per query

💰 Savings: 88% cost reduction, 88% token reduction
```

### Monthly Cost (1000 queries)
- **Traditional**: $72/month
- **Two-Tier**: $8/month
- **Savings**: $64/month (89% reduction)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Specific Store
```javascript
User: "How is Premium Supplements doing?"
Haiku: Identifies 1 store by name
Context: Full (mode: 'single')
Tokens: ~1,400
Cost: $0.004
```

### Example 2: Bottom Performers
```javascript
User: "Help me fix my 3 worst stores"
Haiku: Sorts by revenue, selects bottom 3
Context: Full for 3 (mode: 'small_group')
Tokens: ~2,800
Cost: $0.008
```

### Example 3: Regional Filter
```javascript
User: "What's working for my Australian brands?"
Haiku: Filters by region="Australia", finds 4 stores
Context: Full for 4 (mode: 'small_group')
Tokens: ~3,600
Cost: $0.011
```

### Example 4: Nickname
```javascript
User: "Update me on the supplement powerhouse"
Haiku: Matches store_nickname, identifies 1 store
Context: Full (mode: 'single')
Tokens: ~1,400
Cost: $0.004
```

### Example 5: Large Portfolio
```javascript
User: "Give me portfolio insights" (40 stores)
Haiku: Identifies all 40, no specific filter
Context: Minimal (mode: 'large_summary')
Response: "Please specify which stores to analyze"
Tokens: ~2,400
Cost: $0.007
```

2. **Populate store descriptions**: Add `store_description` data to existing stores
3. **Monitor Haiku accuracy**: Check confidence scores in responses

### Short-term
1. **Integrate into frontend**: Connect UI to `/api/ai/chat-tiered`
2. **Add conversation history**: Store multi-turn conversations
3. **Add caching**: Cache Haiku results for repeated queries

### Long-term
1. **Analytics dashboard**: Track which filters are most used
2. **Fine-tune Haiku prompt**: Improve identification accuracy
3. **Add more filter types**: Industry-specific, date-based, etc.

## 🎓 How It Works

### The Magic

**User says**: "How are my bottom 3 performing stores doing?"

**What happens**:
1. **Haiku receives**: List of all 30 stores (minimal data: name, metrics)
2. **Haiku thinks**: "Bottom 3 performers = sort by revenue, take lowest 3"
3. **Haiku responds**: `["store1", "store2", "store3"]` + reasoning
4. **Context builder**: Builds full context for these 3 stores
5. **Sonnet receives**: Rich context ONLY for these 3 stores
6. **Sonnet analyzes**: Deep dive into why they're underperforming

**Result**: Focused, relevant answer using 2.8K tokens instead of 24K!

### The Intelligence

**Haiku understands**:
- "supplement powerhouse" = store with that nickname
- "Australian brands" = filter by region
- "bottom 3" = sort by revenue, take lowest
- "low retention" = sort by repeat_rate, take lowest
- "premium stores" = sort by AOV, take highest

**Context builder adapts**:
- 1-5 stores → Full detail for all
- 6-20 stores → Full for mentioned, summary for rest
- 20+ stores → Minimal unless filtered
