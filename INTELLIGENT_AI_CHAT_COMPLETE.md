## 🤖 How It Works

### User Types Natural Question

```
User: "How did my stores perform this week?"
```

### System Intelligence

1. **Detection:** "perform" + "this week" = Performance query ✅
2. **Time Parse:** "this week" = Past 7 days
3. **Prompt Selection:** 7 days = Use 7-Day Prompt
4. **Data Fetch:** Query ClickHouse for past 7 days with store names
5. **Analysis:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 with specialized 7-day prompt
6. **Response:** Store-specific, campaign-specific insights

### Response Example

```markdown
## 📊 This Week's Performance

**BeautyBrand:**
- Sent 3 campaigns, $12,450 revenue
- **Best:** "Weekend Sale" Oct 20 - $5,800 (22% open)
- **Issue:** "Flash Sale" Oct 18 - 12% open (vs 22% avg)

**SkincareShop:**
- Sent 2 campaigns, $8,200 revenue
- **Critical:** "Abandoned Cart" Email #2 broken (0.8% click, was 3.2%)

### 🔴 THIS WEEK's Priorities:

1. **BeautyBrand** - Fix subject lines for Friday's campaign
   Impact: +$1,428/send

2. **SkincareShop** - Fix "Abandoned Cart" Email #2 CTA
   Impact: $37/week + critical fix
```
